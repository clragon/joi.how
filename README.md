This is a small application I've been working on for a bit. Just a web app e621 slideshow that has a jack-off-instruction-style stroke-to-the-beat UI! If you find that sort of thing interesting, check it out [here](https://joi.how)!

I'm also taking feature requests! If there's anything you'd like to see added, feel free to [open an issue](/issues) or ask in the [forum thread](https://e621.net/forum_topics/23796).
