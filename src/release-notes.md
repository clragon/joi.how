### What is intensity?

The game keeps an internal tally of what it thinks your current "edge level" should be. This is recorded as intensity from 0 - 100. This version ties more of the game to intensity and should hopefully track closer to how edged you really are! I am working on a way to self report this in game as well, **cumming soon.**
